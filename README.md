# Andrew's Tauri App

This project was created following the steps on the Tauri [tauri docs site](https://tauri.studio/docs/getting-started/beginning-tutorial) and bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

So far I have added a countdown functionality with fixed 30 minutes time, when the time starts it closes a specified list (hard-coded for now) and at the end of the time it opens the list of apps again.

## Future Tasks

- [ ] Toolbar menu icon with dropdown containing the same information (time left, button to start/pause)
- [ ] Ability to choose music via the Spotify API
- [ ] Ability to customise the apps that are closed and opened
- [x] Customise the time period - Now have a settings page
- [ ] Auto update of app
- [ ] Deployment and hosting on Github
